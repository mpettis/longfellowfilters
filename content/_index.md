# Our Mission

We want our children, teachers, and staff to be as safe from COVID as we can manage.  To help with this in classrooms and other enclosed spaces, we want to build these.  More specifically, we'd like our students to learn to do this for their own schools.

We can buy the materials and teach the students to assemble them.  We only ask to have the material costs covered.


# How Can These Filters Help

Hospitals use very efficient filters (HEPA filters) to help them keep their air clean for their patients and staff.  As hospitals concentrate a lot of sick people, it is important that they keep the air clean of substances that can transmit disease.  To do this, they use HEPA filters, which are great at removing particles from the air that can make people sick.

But they are quite expensive.  Some engineers asked themselves if they could make something that, while not equal to HEPA filters, were helpful enough in reducing COVID transmission, but with cheaper and available materials.  [This article](https://www.wired.com/story/could-a-janky-jury-rigged-air-purifier-help-fight-covid-19/) describes what they came up with.

In short, with off-the-shelf filters and commodity box fans, we can make filters that do filter air and reduce the risk of COVID transmission.  For schools, such as South High School in Minneapolis, where there are no windows, these filters can be a great helper in supplying clean air in rooms with no functional windows.
